# Space Game

This is a university project. A simple game about a mean spaceship that's dead set on killing all them aliens.

### File structure

- Custom folders
   - `assetsrc`: Source files for graphical assets
- Gamemaker-managed folders
   - `datafiles`: Various external data files
   - `objects`: Object code and Gamemaker metadata
   - `options`: Gamemaker metadata
   - `rooms`: Room code and metadata
   - `sprites`: Sprites and their Gamemaker metadata. **Make sure to replace sprite assets here if you change them externally!!**

### Naming conventions

All filenames, variable names, instance and object names must use `snake_case`.

Function names must also use `snake_case`.

Actually, basically pretty much everything uses `snake_case`. Don't even think of using `camelCase` or `CamelCase` here, heretic!

Global variables use `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.

All sprite names must end with `_sprite`.

### Using git

Please set your git to `rebase` on pull, or run `git pull --rebase` every time you pull. If I see "Merge remote-tracking branch" commit in this repo, I will uwu until you die or turn into a furry.

### Running it

Get gamemaker, compile and run. Should be really straightforward.
